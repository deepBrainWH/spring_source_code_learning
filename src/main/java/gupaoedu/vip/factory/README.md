### Design pattern -- Factory design pattern
```
In class-based programming, the **factory method pattern** is a creational pattern that uses factory  
methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of  
the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method  
—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base  
class   and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.
